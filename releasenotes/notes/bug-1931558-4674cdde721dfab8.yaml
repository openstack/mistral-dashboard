    `Bug #1931558 <https://launchpad.net/bugs/1931558>`_:
    Previosuly Mistral Dashboard leaked contents of local files if a user put
    in a local file path in definitions. Now Mistral Dashboard no longer treats
    inputs as file path or URL but it always use the raw input as resource
    definitions.
